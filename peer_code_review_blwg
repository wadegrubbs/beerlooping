Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
Excellent docs.
Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?
We would've place links to js files in the <head> section and used a more descriptive variable name for the index. Otherwise, it looks great.
Were branching and looping used effectively?
Yeah!
Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?
Indeed.
Is the site user-friendly?
We were hoping it would actually present us with 99 bottles of beer, but perhaps we expect too much. Yes, it was user-friendly.
Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
See above. Looks great.
